# BrickBreaker – Unity Game

Hi! I made this simple brick breaker-style game as a personal project to teach myself coding and Unity.

---

## Controls

- **Move Paddle:**  Arrow Keys or A/D  
- **Launch Ball:** Spacebar  
- **Power-Ups:** Catch them with the paddle to activate effects

---

## Features

- **Classic Arcade Gameplay**  
  Bounce the ball, break bricks, beat your own high score, and clear all the levels to win the game.

- **Accurate Paddle Control**  
  Bounce mechanics are based on where the ball hits the paddle for more control.

- **Multiple Grid Patterns**  
  Includes standard grid, checkerboard, and diagonal brick layouts.

- **Super Ball Power-Up**  
  Breaks multiple bricks in a row with a customised trail and particle effects.  
  Power-ups drop randomly after every 5–7 bricks and give you bonus points for collecting them.

- **Audio Feedback**  
  Simple sound effects for power-up collection, losing lives, and brick collisions — with randomised pitch for variation.

## Future Improvements

- Refine visual and auditory feedback (e.g. effects, breaking animations)
- Polish UI elements (e.g. add background for title screen)
- Include more levels with better difficulty progression
- Introduce a variety of power-ups (e.g. extra lives, different paddle sizes, slow ball etc.)

## Built With

- Unity (2022.3.62f1 LTS)  
- C#  
- Visual Studio  
- Git (for version control)

## Credits & Notes

**Code and Game Design** by me - [denali17](https://github.com/denali17)

I also wanted to add some personal touches to the game's visuals:

- Created a custom shader and material in Unity to enhance the look of the Super Ball power-up trail.
- Made a trail texture in Photoshop to use with my custom material.
- Modified several assets from the brick breaker asset pack below to better suit my design choices.
